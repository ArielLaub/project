    "name": "Secured Business Loan",
    "description": "A secured business loan is when the borrower pledges an asset (such as a plant, equipment, stocks or vehicles) against the debt. If the debt is not repaid, the lender may claim the secured asset. Secured business loans can be used for a wide range of purposes, including: working capital, expansion capital, asset purchase and more. The collateral is the most important aspect of secured business loans because it reduces the risk for the lending company, therefore reducing the interest rate that the borrower pays. <br><br><b>What sort of business might use a Secured Business Loan?</b><br><br> A secured business loan is a good solution for those with a poor credit rating. It is a great option if you want to start a new business or expand your business. If your secured business loan is approved, you will have a lower APR rate and very likely a longer repayment period. This can make it affordable for startup businesses to get the cash they need during a time when profits are just starting to grow.",
    "benefits": "[ \"It is easier to obtain than unsecured finance if your business has a limited track record or the principals have patchy credit ratings\", \"Flexibility of a much longer repayment period, thus reducing the monthly charge\" ]",
    "drawbacks": "[ \"Potential loss of the secured asset if repayments are not made\", \"The interest rate is more likely to be variable. This can work to your advantage if interest rates go down, but you will need to plan carefully at a time when rates rise.\" ]"

    "name": "Unsecured Business Loan",
    "description": "An unsecured business loan is a type of funding solution that does not require a personal or business asset to be used as collateral. This type of loan is given to a business based on the healthy financials of the business and a high credit score.<br>Because unsecured business loans don\'t require a security or assets as collateral, there is a higher risk for the lenders that the loan will not get paid back. Therefore the interest rates will normally be higher than for secured loans.<br>The amount of the loan and what it is used for can determine the rate of the interest. Although unsecured loans tend to have higher interest rates, they can still be lower than other funding solutions<br><br><b>What sort of business might use an Unsecured Business loan?</b><br><br>A business with limited assets or one that does not want to provide collateral, may be able to obtain an unsecured loan. The business would normally be subject to a credit check and would therefore have to be able to meet a strong level of credit-worthiness. In some situations, a personal guarantee may also be required from the company’s owners or directors.",

    "description": "A Revenue Advance or Merchant Cash Advance is a type of funding solution that provides businesses with flexible terms, where they repay the funding based on future sales. With a revenue advance there is no fixed interest on the loan, instead the business pays an agreed upon percentage of future sales until the loan (plus interest) is repaid.<br>In a typical scenario, businesses are normally able to borrow up to three times their average monthly revenue.<br><br><b>What sort of business might use a Revenue Advance?</b><br><br>This type of funding is especially useful for growing businesses, allowing them the flexibility to maintain healthy cash-flow while returning the loan as their sales grow.<br>The business does not have to worry about any temporary slowdown in sales because they pay a fixed percentage of the revenue. This is in contrast to a traditional loan which would have a fixed payment schedule, and would need to be repaid even when revenue slows down.",

    "name": "Equity Crowd Funding",
    "description": "Equity crowd funding enables individuals and accredited investors to invest in private businesses and startups in exchange for shares in the business or a promise for a share of future returns.<br>It is similar to peer to peer lending, in that it takes place on public websites, but investors are not making loans to a company, rather they are buying some equity. As a result investors or shareholders have the potential to enjoy the success of the business, but also can risk losing their investment should the business fail.<br><br><br><b>What sort of business might use equity crowd funding?</b><br><br>A new business that has a new creative idea or needs additional funding, may be happy to sell equity (and therefore some of the potential future profits) rather than taking out a loan. Though if the crowd funding does not generate enough investor interest, the business may have to turn to more traditional business lending options.",
    "benefits": "[ \"The ability to raise money quickly on websites without having to agree to fundraising commitments set by venture capital firms\", \"Can help raise awareness for new businesses - no upfront fees\", \"Investors can track your progress and may help you promote your brand through their networks\", \"An alternative option for businesses that struggle to get bank loans or conventional funding\" ]",

    "name": "Asset Based Finance",
    "description": "Asset based finance is a method of providing a business loan that is secured by an asset. This means, that if the loan is not repaid, the asset is used as collateral and can be taken by the lender. Assets can be accounts receivable, inventory, machinery, equipment and/or real estate. Asset based funding is a great solution for refinancing existing loans, financing growth, mergers and acquisitions.<br>Asset based finance can also be used to generate cash in order to purchase a new asset, where the value of the asset is used as security for the loan.<br><br><b>What sort of business might use Asset Based finance?</b><br><br>Asset based finance (or collateralized loans as they are also known) is a less expensive loan to take because the lender has some security if the loan is not repaid.

    "drawbacks": "[ \"Asset-based lending tends to be more expensive than other financing, often three to five percentage points more expensive than a typical commercial lending relationship, however, it is less expensive than cash flow or stretched-term debt in the marketplace\", \"It is considered relatively dangerous to rely on short term assets for long-term debt.\" ]"

    "name": "Invoice Financing",
    "description": "Invoice financing is a form of funding where a business gets funding by selling its unpaid invoices to a company who will collect the money on the invoices themselves. There are two main types of invoice financing: Invoice Factoring and Invoice Discounting.<br>Invoice Factoring, or debt factoring involves the financier managing the sales ledger and collecting the unpaid invoices. The financing company will buy the debt owed by the customers, purchasing the invoices at a discount and with fees, and claiming the full amount from the customer.<br>Invoice Discounting is when the financier lends a business money against unpaid invoices in return for which the business pays a fee. The collection of debt and unpaid invoices remains with the business. Once the customers pay their invoice, the money goes to the financier. This then allows the business to borrow additional funding on invoices from new sales. With invoice discounting the business’s customers do not know that their invoices were sold to a third party.<br><br><b>What sort of business might use Invoice Funding?</b><br><br>Invoice financing is a recommended form of funding for businesses that are experiencing cashflow problems due to debt from outstanding incoming invoices. A business in this situation could sell their invoices to a financing company and receive up to 90% of the value of the invoice before the customer settles it. This can be helpful (or even essential) for businesses which are experiencing a cash flow downturn, perhaps due to seasonal or other reasons.",
    "benefits": "[ \"An immediate option\", \"No need to give property security\", \"This type of Invoice Finance is offered by Non-Bank Lenders and they are generally a lot more flexible than the Banks (e.g. it is an option for new businesses)\", \"The set up is confidentially between a business and a finance company.

    "drawbacks": "[ \"Only works for businesses that issue invoices for payment on credit, and only for business-to-business transactions. This means businesses paid in cash (credit card / eftpos) and business-to-consumer sales aren\'t eligible\", \"The invoice becomes an asset of the finance company.

    "name": "Revolving credit facilities",
    "description": "Revolving credit facilities is a type of line of credit. It is a financial arrangement made between a lending institution and a business. The lender provides access to funds that can be used at the business\'s discretion. Revolving credit is very similar to a credit card. The lending institution grants a maximum credit limit, which can be used at any time and (usually) on any goods. Many small business owners and corporations use revolving credit to finance capital expansion or as a safeguard in the event of cash flow problems. Once a business builds a history with a lender and makes consistent payments on a revolving credit account, the lender may agree to increase the maximum credit limit. There is no set monthly payment with revolving credit accounts, but interest accrues and is capitalized like any other credit. Once payments are made on the revolving credit account, those funds become available for borrowing again. The credit limit may be used repeatedly as long as the maximum credit line is not exceeded.",
